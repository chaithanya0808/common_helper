# If you already have hash_diff values computed in SQL and stored in a DataFrame in PySpark, and you want to compare them against the MD5 hashes computed for respective columns (student_id, student_roolno, student_firstname, student_lastname) within PySpark, you can proceed as follows:

# Assumption:

# You have a DataFrame df in PySpark that contains a column hash_diff with MD5 hashes computed previously in SQL.
# You want to compute MD5 hashes for the same set of columns (student_id, student_roolno, student_firstname, student_lastname) in PySpark and compare them against hash_diff.
# Steps:

# Use PySpark to compute MD5 hashes for the specified columns.
# Compare the computed hashes (hash_diff) with the hash_diff values already present in your DataFrame.
# Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this in PySpark:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat_ws, coalesce, md5, trim

# Assuming 'spark' is your SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Compare MD5 Hashes").getOrCreate()

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame containing the schema with columns student_id, student_roolno, student_firstname, student_lastname, hash_diff
# 'hash_diff' column should contain MD5 hashes computed previously in SQL

# Define the DataFrame operations to compute MD5 hash for the specified columns
computed_hashes = df.withColumn(
    "computed_hash_diff",
    md5(
        concat_ws(
            "|",
            coalesce(trim(col("student_id")), ""),
            coalesce(trim(col("student_roolno")), ""),
            coalesce(trim(col("student_firstname")), ""),
            coalesce(trim(col("student_lastname")), "")
        )
    )
)

# Filter rows where computed_hash_diff equals hash_diff (from SQL)
matched_rows = computed_hashes.filter(col("computed_hash_diff") == col("hash_diff"))

# Show the rows where the computed hash matches the hash_diff from SQL
matched_rows.show(truncate=False)

# Explanation:
# Imports and SparkSession:

# Start or get the SparkSession (spark) as before.
# DataFrame Operations:

# Use withColumn() to compute computed_hash_diff using md5() function over concatenated values of student_id, student_roolno, student_firstname, and student_lastname.
# concat_ws() concatenates column values using | as the delimiter.
# coalesce() and trim() functions are used to handle null values and trim whitespace from column values as needed.
# Filtering:

# Use filter() to select rows where computed_hash_diff matches hash_diff (already computed in SQL).
# Show Results:

# Display the rows where the computed MD5 hash (computed_hash_diff) matches the hash_diff obtained from SQL using matched_rows.show().
# This code will effectively compare the MD5 hashes computed within PySpark against the pre-computed hash_diff values obtained from SQL, ensuring that you are verifying the integrity of data across systems. Adjust column names (student_id, student_roolno, etc.) and DataFrame (df) according to your actual data structure.
